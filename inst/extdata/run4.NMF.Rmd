### Runs NMF on expression matrix from simulated data saved in exp1.RData, saves resultW and resultH to exp4.NMF.result.RData

#### Loads exp4.RData with list of simulated mixture data, trueH, trueW, unmixed data/signature matrices
```{r}
load("~/rnaGinesis/data/exp4.RData")
```

#### Runs NMF on simulated mixture data and obtains resultW, resultH
```{r}
mixture <- experiment4$ex
# Calls helper method runNMF to run NMF on mixture 
exp4.NMF <- runNMF(mixture, rank = 6)
```

#### Saves results from NMF to .RData file
```{r}
save(exp4.NMF, file = "~/rnaGinesis/data/exp4.NMF.result.RData")

```

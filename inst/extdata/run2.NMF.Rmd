### Runs NMF on expression matrix from scRNA-seq mixture data saved in exp2.RData, saves resultW and resultH to exp2.NMF.result.RData

#### Loads exp2.RData with list of simulated mixture data, trueH, trueW, unmixed data/signature matrices
```{r}
load("~/rnaGinesis/rnaGinesis/data/exp2.RData")
```

#### Runs NMF on scRNA-seq mixture data and obtains resultW, resultH
```{r}
mixture <- experiment2$ex
# Calls helper method runNMF to run NMF on mixture 
exp2.NMF <- runNMF(mixture, rank = 3)
```

#### Saves results from NMF to .RData file
```{r}
save(exp2.NMF, file = "~/rnaGinesis/rnaGinesis/data/exp2.NMF.result.RData")
```

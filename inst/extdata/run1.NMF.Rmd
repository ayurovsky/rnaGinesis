### Runs NMF on expression matrix from simulated data saved in exp1.RData, saves resultW and resultH to exp1.NMF.result.RData

#### Loads exp1.RData with list of simulated mixture data, trueH, trueW, unmixed data/signature matrices
```{r}
load("~/Desktop/stonybrook/simons/moffitt/src/pdac/data/exp1_medium_noise.RData")
```

#### Runs NMF on simulated mixture data and obtains resultW, resultH
```{r}
mixture <- experiment1$ex
# Calls helper method runNMF to run NMF on mixture 
exp1.NMF <- runNMF(mixture, rank = 3)
```

#### Saves results from NMF to .RData file
```{r}
save(exp1.NMF, file = "/Users/anandbanwasi/Desktop/stonybrook/simons/moffitt/src/pdac/data/exp1_medium_noise.NMF.result.RData")
```
